# MyReads Project - Keith Plaisance
---

### Specification

This project allowed me to use React. I used the provided starter code obtained from the Udacity repo. I also installed Yarn to install all dependancies. I used React-Router to be able to start the site on my local machine.

I used a walkthrough by Ryan Waite and Udacity as reference with help figuring out how to setup the app. The link is on the Udacity walkthrough page: https://www.diigo.com/outliner/fkkvtl/Udacity-MyReads%3A-My-Reads%3A-Book-Tracking-App-Project-(project-%236)?key=4sfz2eik4g

### How do I start the application?

I am assuming that Node.js, NPM / Yarn are installed on the machine already.

1. After downloading the files to your local computer, enter the command prompt and navigate to the root directory.

2. In this folder, type "yarn start" to launch a simple HTTP server to serve up the files on your local computer. 

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`

4. This will open the MyReads application.

## Functionality:

On the main page, there are three shelves which the user can move books between. There is also a search page which the user can get to by pressing the green circle with a plus in it at the bottom right of the screen. On this page, you can type in a query and the books will be sorted by what is typed in real time.

The user can click on the drop down next to any book and see the status of the book (which shelf it resides on - or none). This dropdown also gives the ability to move books over to a shelf if they choose to.
